## Data sharing
We share data only with:
- Platform providers you connect (e.g., Instagram Graph API, Pinterest API).
- Infrastructure/analytics processors strictly for running the service.

## Data retention
- Connected account tokens and IDs are kept while your account is linked.
- Logs and analytics are retained for up to 12 months unless legally required longer.
