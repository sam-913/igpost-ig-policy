# Data Deletion Instructions

To delete your data:

1. **In-app:** Use “Disconnect Accounts” → confirms token revocation and removes stored IDs.
2. **Email:** Send a request to **youremail@example.com** using the subject “Data Deletion – Your App Name”.

We will:
- Revoke access tokens,
- Remove linked identifiers and logs associated with your account (within 7–14 days),
- Confirm deletion via email.

If your accounts are managed via Instagram/Pinterest settings, you can also revoke access directly in those platforms’ “Apps and Websites” pages.
